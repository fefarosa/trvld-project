# Trip(pin)

 - Trip(pin) is a full stack web application with front-end built in React and back-end using Express and Mongoose technologies.

## About the application

 - Trip (pin) is an app designed to save your photos and the incredible memories that you have collected throughout your life and your  travels. Use a pin to mark the location from which you took your favorite photo.

## The Requirements

- Use React for all of the user-facing parts of your application.
- Use Express for your API backend that your React app will communicate with.
- Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
- Have 3 models or more.
    - Having one for users is a no-brainer.
    - The other two should represent the main functionality of your app.
    - Donâ€™t force it if having a 3rd model doesnâ€™t make sense.
- Have validation on its models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
- Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
- Have two repos on GitHub. One for your React application and the other for your Express API backend.
- Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
- Be deployed online using Heroku, so anybody could use your app.
- Responsive design is not a requirement.
